# Redux Toolkit Practice App

This is a combined solution to [Redux Toolkit Tutorial â€“ JavaScript State Management Library Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbkBuqC1rU4) and [Redux - Complete Tutorial (with Redux Toolkit) Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yEG6GhoJBs&t=1s). I'm practicing and developing my coding competency by building projects after projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

Learn how to use Redux Toolkit in this course for beginners. Redux Toolkit is from the Redux team and it is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. So if you want to learn Redux to help with state management, this is the video for you.

In this video we will learn about Redux and Redux Toolkit. Redux is a state management library that makes it really easy to have global state in your React application. We are going to learn how to work with modern Redux, using Redux Toolkit to save ourselves some boilerplate code. This is the last video you will ever have to watch on Redux with Redux Toolkit! Enjoy!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework**
- Tailwind CSS**
- Typescript**
- Nodejs (with/without Expressjs)
- MongoDB**  
- GraphQL**    
- Redux Toolkit 

### What I learned

- **GraphQL Explorer**: Using Ctrl + Space provides autocompletion for faster development.  
- **Data Modeling**: While both the `typeDef` file and the `model` define data structure, they serve different purposes:
`typeDef` file: Defines the GraphQL schema (what data is exposed to the client).  
`model`: Defines the data structure for interacting with the MongoDB database.    

### Continued development

- More projects; increased competence!
